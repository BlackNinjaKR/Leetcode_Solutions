/*Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 15
s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].



Intuition
The Roman numeral system has specific rules for combining characters to represent numbers. Roman numerals generally add values sequentially, but when a smaller numeral appears before a larger one (e.g., IV for 4), it indicates subtraction. Observing this allows us to handle the conversion with minimal complexity by processing each character from right to left and subtracting values when appropriate.

Approach
Start from the end of the Roman numeral string, moving towards the beginning.
For each character, determine its integer value.
Keep track of the previous numeral's value. If the current numeralâ€™s value is less than the previous one, it indicates a subtractive combination (e.g., IV, IX), so we subtract the current value. Otherwise, we add it.
Continue this process until all characters are processed. This method ensures that each Roman numeral character is correctly interpreted according to Roman numeral rules.
Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n) where n is the length of the string. We process each character once.

Space complexity:
O(1) since we use only a few variables to track values and perform calculations, regardless of the input size.
