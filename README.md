## About

Each solution is written in Java, and includes:

- **Problem statement**: A summary of the problem, including constraints and examples.
- **Solution approach**: An explanation of the intuition, approach, and complexity analysis.
- **Code**: Java code with comments to clarify the logic and methods used.

The repository will be updated periodically with new solutions.

## Solution Structure

All Java solution files are in a single directory, with each file named to reflect the problem it addresses (e.g., `PalindromeNumber.java`, `ReverseInteger.java`). Each file is self-contained with the problem description, approach, and code.

## Usage

You can clone or download the repository for reference or to run solutions locally.

To run any solution, make sure you have Java installed:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Leetcode-Solutions.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd Leetcode-Solutions
```

Then, compile and run a specific Java file:

```bash
# Compile
javac ProblemName.java

# Run
java ProblemName
```
