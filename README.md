# Leetcode Solutions in Java, C, and C++

A collection of Java, C, and C++ solutions to various Leetcode problems. This repository provides multiple language implementations for algorithm practice and serves as a reference for learners and enthusiasts who want to understand different approaches and paradigms across languages.

---

## About

Each solution is provided in one or more of the supported languages:

- Java
- C++
- C

Each solution typically includes:

- *Problem statement*: A summary of the problem, including constraints and examples.
- *Solution approach*: A brief explanation of the intuition, approach, and complexity analysis.
- *Code*: Well-documented source code with comments to clarify logic.

The repository is updated periodically with new solutions and language variants.

## Solution Structure

Solutions are organized by language:

```
Leetcode-Solutions/
│
├── Java/
│   ├── PalindromeNumber.java
│   └── ReverseInteger.java
│
└── C&C++/
    ├── PalindromeNumber.c
    └── PalindromeNumber.cpp
    └── ReverseInteger.c
    └── ReverseInteger.cpp
```
Each file is self-contained and named to reflect the problem it addresses.

## Usage

You can clone or download the repository to explore and run solutions locally.

```bash
# Clone the repository
